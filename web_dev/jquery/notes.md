I plan on tackling jQuery by looking up YouTube video tutorials, finding cheat sheets, and some other forms of readings online. I'll take notes of anything that I find to be super important. 

Release 1 update! After taking a lunch break and studying up on jquery, I found myself learning a lot from YouTube 'getting started' videos, and from w3schools. I also found some cheat sheets online!
