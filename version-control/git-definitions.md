# Git Definitions (Hi I'm here)

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
* What is a merge conflict?

###Version control is the task of keeping a software system consisting of many configurations well organized. 

###A branch is a lightweight movable pointer to a commit. You can use branches to stay organized and work on tasks, without affecting the master branch. 

###A commit records the changes made to the repository. A good commit message speeds up the reviewing process. 

###A merge conflict is when you try to merge without a common ancestor.
